## Security Best Practices

When using this action, please follow these security practices:

### Secrets Management

- **Never commit secrets** to your repository
- **Use GitHub Secrets** for all sensitive values:
  - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
  - `GHCR_TOKEN` (or use the default `github.token`)
  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
  - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`, `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`
- **Rotate credentials** periodically
- **Use minimal permissions** when creating access tokens (read-only where possible)

### Workflow Security

- **Pin action versions** to a specific version tag or commit SHA:
  ```yaml
  # Good - pinned to version
  uses: drumandbytes/opentofu-updater-action@v1

  # Better - pinned to commit SHA
  uses: drumandbytes/opentofu-updater-action@<commit-sha>
  ```
- **Review pull requests** created by the action before merging
- **Limit workflow permissions** to only what's needed:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
  ```

### Registry Authentication

- Use **read-only tokens** when possible
- Create **dedicated service accounts** for CI/CD pipelines
- Enable **audit logging** on your container registries

## Security Features

This action includes several security features:

- **No credential logging**: Secrets are never logged or exposed in outputs
- **Sandboxed execution**: Runs in an isolated GitHub Actions environment
- **Input validation**: All inputs are validated before use
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only `aiohttp`, `pyyaml`, and `packaging` are required

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure:

1. Reporter submits vulnerability privately
2. We confirm and assess the issue
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the fix and publish a security advisory
5. Reporter may be credited (with permission)
